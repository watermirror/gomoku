- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness
